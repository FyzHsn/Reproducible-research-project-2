Reproducible-research-project-2
===============================

This is assignment 2 from the course Reproducible Research on coursera.

Introduction
------------

Storms and severe weather can have a tremendous negative impact both economically and in public health of communities and municipalities. Forseeing and preventing fatalities, injuries and property damage from such  extreme events is a key concern.  

In this project we explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks: characteristics of major storms and weather events in the U.S., when and where they occur, and estimates of fatalities, injuries and property damage.

Data
----

The data for this website is in the form of a csv file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm. The file can be downloaded from:  

* https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2  

Information regarding some of the variables can be found at:
