Introduction
------------

Storms and severe weather can have a tremendous negative impact both economically and in public health of communities and municipalities. Forseeing and preventing fatalities, injuries and property damage from such  extreme events is a key concern.  

In this project we explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks: characteristics of major storms and weather events in the U.S., when and where they occur, and estimates of fatalities, injuries and property damage.
